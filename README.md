# Linear-finite-difference-for-boundary-value-problems
This is another Final project for Numerical Calculus III. It uses a centered differce matrix and can be easily 
adapted to other problems.
There are many applications of one-dimensional second order two-point boundary value problems.
• Physical problems such as the pendulum model, the elastic string model, etc.
• For high dimensional axi-symmetric problems, the elliptic second partial differential
equations can be written as a two-point boundary value problems.
• The steady state solution of a boundary value problem of the heat equation equation
This is a generic problem
